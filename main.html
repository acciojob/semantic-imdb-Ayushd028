			NASA secretly recruits him for a mission to find a new home for humanity. Alongside a team of scientists, including <strong>Dr. Brand (Anne Hathaway)</strong>, Cooper travels through a wormhole near Saturn to explore potentially habitable planets in another galaxy. Meanwhile, he struggles with leaving behind his daughter, <strong>Murph (Mackenzie Foy / Jessica Chastain)</strong>, who later plays a key role in solving Earth's survival equation.
